extern const hkClass hkpGroupFilterClass;

/// This is an example collision filter. 
/// The collision filter implementation can be a significant factor in performance of your physics. 
/// Using this filter (or one very like it) for all your filtering will give optimal cache performance 
/// and we strongly recommend using this if possible.
///
/// This filter is designed to allow custom filtering between bones in different 
/// ragdolls or other constrained systems in your world, by doing simple operations on two 32 bit numbers. 
/// The collision detection pipeline is setup to produce these 32 bit numbers, called collision filter infos.
///
/// It inherits from hkpCollisionFilter, and so implements each of the 4 hkpCollisionFilter::isCollisionEnabled
/// methods. For each method, it extracts two 32 bit values from the inputs (one representing each object to be
/// tested), and passes these values to a common filtering mechanism.
///
/// We split the 32 bit value into a system group (16 bits), a layer (5 bits), and a subsystem id (5 bits),
/// and the id of another subsystem that we do not want to collide with (5 bits). 
///
/// The filter allows the user to specify whether collisions are enabled or disabled between every pair of layers
/// and between members of the same system.
///
/// The exact logic of the filter is as follows:
/// If both bodies are in the same system group, use the subsystem check.
/// If bodies are in different systems, use the layer check.
/// If both bodies are in same system AND that system is 0, use the layer check.
/// 
/// Layer-Layer collision disabling is set in the filter itself.
/// Subsystem collision disabling is set in the filterinfo.
///
/// Some things to keep in mind:
///
///     - Collisions between layer 0 and any other layer should not be disabled (by default all layers
///       collide with all other layers, including themselves). This is a policy decision for shape collection filtering.
///       All shape collections are required to implement hkpShapeCollection::getCollisionFilterInfo for each child shape.
///       By default this returns 0 (i.e., if no special child shape filter information is set).
///       So if you disable layer 0 in the group filter and use this filter as a shape collection filter,
///       it will disable collisions with children of all default shape collections.
///     - System group 0 is special in that if two objects of system group 0 are under consideration, their subsystem id
///       will not be considered. Instead, only the layer information will be used.
///
/// The class provides helper methods for getting and setting these values.
///
/// Examples:
///
///     - Keyframed objects should not collide with static geometry. Therefore
///       we can put all static geometry into one layer and all the keyframed object into
///       another layer. Then we disable the collision between these layers.
///     - All elements of a ragdoll should collide with each other, except those that are connected by
///       a constraint. In this case we assign all bodies of the ragdoll to the same system group. Also we assign
///       a unique subSystemId for each body in the ragdoll. Then we set subSystemDontCollideWith
///       to the id of the parent rigidbody (assuming you see the ragdoll as a hierarchy of bodies
///       and constraints, see the hkaRagdollUtils for details).
///
/// Note:
///
/// If two shape collections A and B collide, the following will happen
///     - The collidable of A and B will be checked.
///     - Then, one of the collections will be expanded, say in our case A will be replaced by
///       its children A# = { A0, A1, ... An }.
///     - Each collisionInfo of child A# (see hkpShapeCollection::getCollisionFilterInfo()) will
///       be tested against hkpCollidable::getCollisionFilterInfo() of B.
///     - Then for each A# B will be expanded into its children B# = {B0, B1, ...Bn}.
///     - Each collisionInfo of child A# (see hkpShapeCollection::getCollisionFilterInfo()) will be tested
///       against collisionInfo of child B#.
///
/// Interestingly, B was never tested against A#. That means if you have a complex shape collection hierarchy,
/// you think about your filters very carefully.
