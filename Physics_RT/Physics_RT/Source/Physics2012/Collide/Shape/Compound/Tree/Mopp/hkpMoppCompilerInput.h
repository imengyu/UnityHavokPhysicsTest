/// This class holds the parameters that affect the building of an hkpMoppCode. See the following long description for details.
/// The hkpMoppCompilerInput will be
/// initialised with default values that may be sub-optimal
/// for a particular geometry. Because of this, the values should be set
/// with the appropriate methods before the hkpMoppCode is built. The following
/// description explains these values and how to set them:
///
/// What does a bounding volume tree do?
///
/// In order to quickly find collisions between a moving object and a large static geometry,
/// the triangles of the static geometry are hierarchically grouped in
/// a binary bounding volume tree.
///
/// To do collision detection between a
/// moving body and a static geometry (for instance, a landscape), the bounding box of the body
/// is checked against the bounding volume tree. A list of possibly colliding triangles
/// is then passed to the narrowphase collision detection. You can view
/// the bounding volume tree as a filter to the narrowphase collision
/// detection system.
///
/// This bounding volume tree is also used when performing raycasts and linear casts.
/// At every node in the tree there exists a bounding polytope, which encapsulates all
/// of its children.
///
/// The nodes on the leaf levels encapsulate one hkpShape, normally a
/// triangle. (The rest of this explanation uses triangles as an example of a leaf node).
/// The fit of this bounding volume can be perfect (as in some AABB trees), or can
/// have an extra margin/tolerance built in (e.g. MOPP). For more information please see the
/// section on Creating Shapes in the Collision Detection chapter of the Physics manual.
///
/// Why is the MOPP so memory efficient?
///
/// The MOPP-tree is an optimised polytope tree, based on the same principles as KDOP
/// trees. In order to keep the memory down, the MOPP data structures:
///    - use a reduced floating point resolution to store the extents of each MOPP node.
///    - store the minimum number of extents for each node.
///    - implement various compression techniques to reduce the overall size.
///
/// How do the parameters affect the building process?
///
/// There is a tolerance (called the fit tolerance) for the MOPP that describes
/// how closely the bounding volumes at the leaf nodes approximate the ideal bounding volume.
/// The MOPP building process uses the hkpMoppCompilerInput to allow you to specify which is
/// more highly optimised - the size of the tree, or how closely the leaf nodes bound the triangles.
/// This means that:
///    - The smaller the fit tolerance of the bounding volumes, the more memory is needed
///      to store the bounding volume information.
///    - The smaller the fit tolerance, the less triangles are passed to the narrow
///      phase collision detector and the less CPU is needed.
///
/// How can I get the best trade off between speed and memory usage?
///
/// Fit tolerance has the largest influence on speed and memory size.
/// There are two fit tolerance settings:
///    - one scalar for the general case \b m_absoluteFitToleranceOfTriangles
///    - and one hkVector4 specifically for axis aligned triangles \b _absoluteFitToleranceOfAxisAlignedTriangles
///
/// The fit tolerance defines how accurately the MOPP bounding
/// volumes approximates perfect bounding volumes. You can define a fit
/// tolerance for triangle level nodes and internal nodes. Normally only the triangle
/// level fit tolerance is important for the overall performance - the internal
/// fit tolerance has only a limited effect on the tree and you should use the
/// default values.
///
/// If your game can afford a loose fit of the bounding volumes, your memory consumption decreases.
/// The following are some simple guidelines to calculate the necessary fit of the MOPP tree:
///    - If your application is a flight simulator, the player's avatar will spend most of the time
///      away from the landscape. Assuming that you have an average triangle edge length of 10 meters,
///      a pretty loose m_absoluteFitToleranceOfTriangles of 2-5 meters (which is 20%-50% of the triangle edge length)
///      should suffice.
///    - In a quake level environment with lots of triangles of all sizes, the player's avatar will
///      almost always be in contact with the landscape. This means that the narrowphase will always
///      have some possible collisions to resolve. As any narrowphase check is far more expensive than
///      the MOPP check, decreasing m_absoluteFitToleranceOfTriangles to ~10% of the triangle edge length
///      will keep the CPU time to a minimum. In a level with an average triangle edge length of 1 meter, this is
///      approximately 0.1 meters.
///    - For a racing game on a mostly flat terrain (triangle edge length ~5 meters),
///      you should ensure that the flat triangles on the course
///      get a very tight fit in direction of the up axis (e.g. 'y-axis').
///      A general m_absoluteFitToleranceOfTriangles of ~0.5 meters (~10% of the triangle edge length) and a
///      m_absoluteFitToleranceOfAxisAlignedTriangles.y = 0.02 meters (~0.4% of the triangle edge length)
///      should give optimal results. You should try to ensure that the distance of the car to the
///      ground does not get too small, unless the game does not allow for this (Formula 1 and
///      Nascar racing cars have very low suspension).
///    - For a game in a city with tall straight buildings, it is useful to set the axis aligned
///      fit tolerance to a small value for collision detection with the walls. This means decreasing
///      the x and z components of m_absoluteFitToleranceOfAxisAlignedTriangles to roughly the same
///      as the y component, at ~4% (or slightly more as collision detection between the street and the users
///      avatar will be more common than with the buildings, depending on game logic).
///    - In a hilly terrain motorbike/offroad vehicle game with an average triangle edge length of 5 meters,
///      most of the triangles normals are not parallel to the main major axes. Therefore, the fit
///      of an AABB or a KDOP node is already suboptimal and setting a very tight fit for the MOPP
///      will not improve the overall performance.
///      In this case m_absoluteFitToleranceOfTriangles = 0.5f and m_absoluteFitToleranceOfAxisAlignedTriangles = hkVector4(0.1f, 0.1f, 0.1f)
///      should give a good result.
