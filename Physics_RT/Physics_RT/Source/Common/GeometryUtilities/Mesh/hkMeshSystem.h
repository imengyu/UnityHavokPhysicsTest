/// The hkMeshSystem interface is designed to be a fairly low level interface to a rendering system.
///
/// The interfaces involved with the hkMeshSystem are
///
/// hkMeshMaterial - A wrapper for a render specific implementation of a material.
/// hkMeshVertexBuffer - An interface to an array of vertices, whose style is described by an hkVertexFormat object.
/// hkMeshShape - A set of one or more mesh sections - a mesh section defines a material, a vertex buffer and a number of render primitives.
/// hkMeshBody - A renderable instantiation of a hkMeshShape. Holds the position of the shape in the world - may hold per instance vertex data.
/// hkMeshSystem - Can construct all of the above, and holds the set of all of the hkMeshBodys which are being rendered.
///
/// Only objects created on the hkMeshSystem can be used to create other hkMeshSystem objects. For example behavior is
/// undefined if you create a vertex buffer on one instantiation of the hkMeshSystem interface, and try and use it on
/// another.
///
/// In the SDK there are currently two implementations of the hkMeshSystem interface - hkgMeshSystem and hkMemoryMeshSystem. The hkgMeshSystem
/// implements the hkMeshSystem for Havok's platform independent 'HKG' graphics library. The hkMemoryMeshSystem is an implementation
/// which cannot perform any rendering, but holds all of the information about vertex buffers, materials and so forth in memory.
/// Thus it allows you to use all of the hkMeshSystem converters and utilities even in an environment with no graphics support.
/// For example you could use the hkMemoryMeshSystem implementation in an exporter to provide processing support.
/// Also depending on your target hkMeshSystem implementation, using the hkMemoryMeshSystem may be significantly faster
/// during processing, as it uses cached system memory - whereas a hardware implementation of a vertex buffer may return
/// memory which is slow.
///
/// An important point about hkMeshShape construction is that the hkMeshVertexBuffers that the hkMeshShape references, must already be filled in with
/// information. This is necessary - because an implementation may use that information to create a bounding volume around the object.
///
/// NOTE! That once a hkMeshShape has been constructed with a hkVertexBuffer it should be considered immutable. Altering a vertex buffer
/// once a hkMeshShape has been constructed using it produces undefined results, and is implementation specific. Not having the
/// restriction allows an implementation more opportunities to optimize vertex data, and for simpler implementation.
///
/// If there is a need for modifications of vertex data - this can be achieved by specifying the elements of the vertex buffer
/// as being not shared - and so they can be modified via the vertex buffer retrieved from the hkMeshBody. The only limitation
/// is that it is not possible to have all instantiations of bodies vertex buffers change by altering a single vertex buffer.
