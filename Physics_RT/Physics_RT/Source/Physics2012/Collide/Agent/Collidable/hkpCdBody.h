	/// The hkpCdBody class is a helper class, which is used to traverse
	/// the shape hierarchy. It is used for all narrowphase collision detection queries.
	/// It contains a shape, and an associated transform. Given two hkpCdBody classes, you
	/// can query for the closest distance using the hkCollisionAgentInterface.
	/// Note: You do not instantiate this class directly. Use the hkpCollidable, which inherits from
	/// hkpCdBody instead.
	///
	/// This class is also created temporarily by the collision detector during queries.
	/// For example, when querying a shape against a landscape, hkpCdBody classes are created
	/// for each sub-shape in the landscape. When hkpCdBody classes are referenced in callbacks,
	/// their data may only be temporary, and you should not hold references to them.
	///
	/// This class holds either a pointer to a transform or a motionState.
	/// The motion state pointer is used only for the internal processCollision call hierarchy.
	/// The transform pointer is used for all other collision detection queries
