/// events, but have no physical effect.
///
/// Passing a rigid body into the constructor of a new TriggerVolume converts it into a trigger
/// volume and no further work need be done. The object manages its own memory and keeps itself
/// alive so long as its triggerBody is alive. The trigger volume sets the world to fire
/// collisionAdded/Removed callbacks for its duration.
///
/// Notes:
///     - The events are usually fired at the end of the physics step by a postSimulationCallback.
///       They can also be fired when the triggerVolume is removed from the world, or explicitly
///       by calling updateOverlaps.
///     - The events are fired in deterministic order, and the m_overlappingBodies array is kept in
///       deterministic order.
///     - Although the trigger volume can detect a body which entered and left the volume during
///       a frame, it cannot detect a body which left and re-entered the volume during a frame.
///       In this case, no events are issued.
///     - You should not assume that the body in a leaving event is still in the world.
