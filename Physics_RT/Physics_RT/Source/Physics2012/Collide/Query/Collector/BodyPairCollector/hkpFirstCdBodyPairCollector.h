	/// hkpFirstCdBodyPairCollector collects the first body pair (e.g., from a hkpCollisionAgent::getPenetrations() call).
	/// It simply stores the pair, and sets the early out flag to true, to prevent any further collision detection being
	/// evaluated. It is useful if you want to simply know whether two objects (where one or both are shape collections)
	/// are overlapping or not, and you want to know the shape keys of the first overlapping object found.
	/// Note: As this class actually can't store the hkpCdBody, it converts each hkpCdBody into
	/// the rood hkpCollidable and the (leave) hkpShapeKey. If you have only one hkpShapeCollection in your shape hierarchy,
	/// this information should be enough to identify your triangle. If you need access to all details, you have to
	/// implement your own hkpCdBodyPairCollector.
