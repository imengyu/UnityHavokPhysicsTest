/// terminals from the MOPP. This class queries the MOPP with the AABB of all terminals
/// being removed to speed up the building of the internal tables. To get good performance,
/// the triangles to remove should be all in the same area (so that the AABB is small).
/// The construction of a hkpRemoveTerminalsMoppModifier does the AABB query described
/// above, so is not as fast as the actual removal, or you can use a pre-calculated AABB.
/// Since applying a modifier (via the applyRemoveTerminals() method) modifies the MOPP
/// code in-place, to 'undo' a removal (for example on level restart/reload) you must use
/// the same modifier and call the undoRemoveTerminals() method.
/// N.B. Modifiers must be 'undone' in the *reverse order* to that in which they were applied.
