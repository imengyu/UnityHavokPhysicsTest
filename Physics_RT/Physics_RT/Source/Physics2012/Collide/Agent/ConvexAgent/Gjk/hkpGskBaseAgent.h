	/// A GSK agent (all classes deriving from this class) handles collisions between pairs of hkConvexShapes using the GSK algorithm.
	/// For all shape pairs, where no direct implementation is available, the collision detection falls back
	/// to this hkpGskBaseAgent agent.
	/// As this agent has no clue about the real surface of the shape, it only can try to sample
	/// (hkpConvexShape::getSupportingVertex()) the shapes involved.
	/// This is quite a slow process (bad), however this agent can use frame coherency very very effectively.
	/// As a result we get a number of properties:
	///   - The first or uncached call to this agent is quite expensive (2-5 times the cached non first call)
	///   - If caching is used and the objects don't penetrate, than the performance is good,
	///     typically only 1.5-3 times slower than a specialized agent (e.g., box-box or sphere-sphere)
	///   - If the objects penetrate, than a slower algorithm gets started (about 2-5 times slower than the non penetrating one)
	///   - To do caching effectively, quite some memory is needed (the size of this agent is roughly 64 Bytes)
	///   - If you use caching and the distance between the two objects is big, than the algorithm has an
	///     early out (called tim) which is really fast (as fast as a sphere-sphere check).
	///
	/// In real game scenarios the following is
	///   - If two convex objects collide, this agent behaves pretty well. As the number of convex-convex object
	///     pairs in a scene are often limited, memory is no big issue.
	///   - if a convex object hits a triangle landscape, quite some triangle can become potential collision partners.
	///     E.g. if a ragdoll with 10 bones falls onto a flowerpot with 100 individual triangles, 10 * 100 agents are
	///     created, resulting in ~80 kBytes of memory consumption. If you are low on memory, you have to be very
	///     careful when designing your collision geometry
	///
	/// The hkpGskBaseAgent serves as a base for all different variants of GSK agents and
	/// implements all functions but the process collision call
