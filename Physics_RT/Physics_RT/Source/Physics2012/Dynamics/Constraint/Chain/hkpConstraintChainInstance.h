	/// hkpConstraintChainInstance allows you to create chains of constraints which are solved with a full-matrix solver (as opposed to Havok's iterative solver).
	/// This approach allows for creating much more stable setups. It is useful for creating long ropes, linking objects with high relative mass ratio, and creating
	/// more sturdy rag-doll setups.
	///
	/// Solving of the constraint chains is based on the solver-in-a-solver approach. The entire constraint-chain is treated by the main Havok's solver as a single
	/// constraint. When the chain is processed it performs calculations on all its bodies at once using its own custom information. This means that in itself
	/// the constraint chain is perfectly stiff, however if single elements of the chain are colliding with other objects, separation can occur.
	/// 
	/// If you have a more complicated constraint system, like a ragdoll, you can use several constraint chain instances at the same time.
	/// Example, you can create a chain going from the left foot to the right hand and another one going from the right foot to the left hand.
	/// Ideally the body/bodies which are shared by the two chains should be as heavy as possible to reduce stretching artifacts.
	///
	/// Note: Constraints chains must use PRIORITY_PSI. Constraint chains do not support TOI-event solving.
	///
	/// hkpConstraintChainInstance implements hkpConstraintInstance's interface and is treated by hkDynamics just like a normal constraint. However the hkpConstraintInstance
	/// is designed to only connect two rigid bodies. hkpConstraintChainInstance stores internally the full list of bodies it links. That information is then passed
	/// to the constraint constraint solver with hkpConstraintChainInstance's custom code.
	///
	/// In order to properly react to e.g., bodies being removed from the hkpWorld, a hkpConstraintChainInstance is always coupled with a hkpConstraintChainInstanceAction
	/// which is automatically added to the world with the constraint chain. This action makes sure that the constraint-chain is removed from the world when some of the bodies
	/// that it references are missing.
	///
	/// Data organization:
	///  - hkpConstraintChainInstance stores the list of bodies linked.
	///  - The constraint properties are stored in its hkpConstraintChainData.
	///  - The current state of those constraints is stored in the chain's Runtime.
