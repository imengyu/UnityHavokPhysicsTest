/// The hkVertexFormat defines the 'elements' which make up a vertex.
///
/// An element in this context is a usage and associated type. For example a vertex buffer which has positional
/// and normal information would consist of two elements. An element for position (USAGE_POSITION), of 3 floats (TYPE_FLOAT32, 3 values),
/// and another for the normal (USAGE_NORMAL) or 3 floats (TYPE_FLOAT32, 3 values)
///
/// Each element has a usage, and sub usage. The usage and sub usage values should uniquely identify an element in a vertex
/// format. The sub usage allows you to have more than one element with the same usage. A simple example of this could be
/// with texture coordinates - the sub usage identifies the channel for the texture coordinates.
///
/// You can build a vertex format by adding elements, specifying their usage, types and flags.
/// In order to simplify processing of vertex formats, the elements must always be in a well defined order before they are
/// used for anything. This order is usage / sub usage order. You can either add the elements in this order, or when you've
/// added all of the elements call makeCanonicalOrder to automatically sort the elements into the appropriate order. Using
/// makeCanonicalOrder is the recommended way of producing a valid vertex format, as it is future proof. If elements have
/// been added in order, makeCanonicalOrder operates particularly rapidly.
///
/// The flags deserve particular note in they can have a significant effect the vertex buffers behavior. The flag FLAG_NOT_SHARED
/// is important - as it defines which components of a vertex buffer should be 'per instance'. If the vertex buffer is cloned
/// these elements will be deep copied. Elements without the flag may be shared by both the original vertex buffer and the
/// new vertex buffer.
///
/// NOTE that behavior is undefined if you try to modify a shared component of shared vertex buffer. This gives an implementation
/// of a vertex buffer more flexibility. In particular a simple implementation could deep copy all components if a single
/// component is shared.
