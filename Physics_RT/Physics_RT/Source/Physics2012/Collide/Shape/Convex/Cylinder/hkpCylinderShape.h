extern const hkClass hkpCylinderShapeClass;

	/// A cylinder defined by two points and a radius.
	/// The points define the centers of the circular ends of the cylinder.
	///
	/// Note, that with default settings the cylinder's radius must be not larger than ~35times the collision tolerance
	/// ( radius of 3.5 meters, with default collision tolerance). Otherwise jitter and 'popping' can be noticed for rolling cylinders.
	/// To workaround you can increase tessellation of cylinders (see below),
	/// or consider increasing collision tolerance (if you're using non-standard settings). (More details in HVK-5156.)
	///
	/// hkpCylinderShape is not modeled as an implicit geometry (hkpSphereShape and hkpCapsuleShape are implicitly modeled).
	/// hkpCylinderShape is represented by vertices generated on the cylinder's surface. Those vertices
	/// are efficiently generated on-the-fly, and do not take up extra memory.
	/// They are referred to as being virtual.
	///
	/// This virtual tessellation causes instability in collision response. For that reason
	/// hkpCylinderShape uses a specialized collision agent, hkPredGskCylinderAgent3.
	/// hkPredGskCylinderAgent3 uses an implicit capsule representation
	/// when the cylinder lies on its side or rolls on a flat surface.
	/// There is a simple mechanism that checks the cylinder's axis angle with the contact normal,
	/// once the angle passes a specified threshold, the object's representation is altered.
	///
	/// As hkPredGskCylinderAgent3 alters the geometrical representation of the cylinder, it reduces the contact information
	/// and this reduction may result in objects tunneling through each other. In a test where a 1cm-radius cylinder collided against
	/// a triangle, and the cylinder was constantly pushed towards the triangle's surface with very high impulses,
	/// the cylinder tunneled through after a few seconds of simulation. Generally, under 'normal' conditions, the hkPredGskCylinderAgent3
	/// yields stable results.
	///
	/// hkPredGskCylinderAgent3 is not used when an hkpCylinderShape is enclosed in an hkpShapeCollection
	/// hierarchy e.g., when an hkpCylinderShape is part of an hkpListShape.
	///
	/// A problem + work-around for such cases:
	///
	/// hkpCylinderShape is tessellated, not implicit like hkpSphereShape or hkpCapsuleShape. This leads
	/// to an issue with cylinders rolling on their sides which may cause them to penetrate other
	/// objects or have incorrect momentum properties. To work around this problem, use a list
	/// shape consisting of an hkpCylinderShape and an hkpCapsuleShape. The hkpCylinderShape ensures
	/// that the list shape can stand on its ends. The hkpCapsuleShape ensures that the list
	/// shape rolls properly. You will want to use a minimally tessellated cylinder sub-shape.
	///
	/// Note that this workaround does not work for cylinders that are flat e.g., coins. In these
	/// cases the capsule ends protrude from the faces of the coin.
	///
	/// Remember to disable hkPredGskCylinderAgent3 if you want to use this workaround for all cases.
	///
	/// You can vary the tessellation of cylinders by calling hkpCylinderShape::setNumberOfSideSegments().
	/// This indicates how many facets should make up the round side of the cylinder (see the function's description).
	///
	/// N.B. Changing this parameter affects ALL hkCylinderShapes. It should only be changed
	/// before creating the world. Changing it with hkCylinderShapes in the world can cause an assert in the
	/// convex collision agent.
