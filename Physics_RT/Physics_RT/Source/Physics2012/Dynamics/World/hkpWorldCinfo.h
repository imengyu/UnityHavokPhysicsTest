			/// Used to specify the speed/stiffness balance of the core solver.
			/// Havok's solver is an iterative solver and similar to a 'successive
			/// over relaxation' (SOR) method. That means that each constraint will not
			/// be solved perfectly, but rather solved like a very stiff spring,
			/// which gives the solver a 'soft' feeling. So the goal of the solver
			/// is to make the constraint to appear hard.
			/// There are 3 parameters to control the behavior of the solver:
			///  - m_solverIterations: defines how often the solver iterates over
			///    all constraints. The higher the number, the stiffer the constraints,
			///    however you need to spend more CPU. Values between 2 and 16 are
			///    reasonable, higher values could lead to instable behavior (in this
			///    case you can achieve the same results by decreasing the physics delta time).
			///  - m_tau: defines how much of the current constraint error is solved every
			///    solver iteration. High values (0.8 .. 1.2 ) make the constraints harder,
			///    however they get more unstable as well. Smaller numbers (0.3 .. 0.6) give
			///    much softer and smoother behavior, however you have to set the number of iterations
			///    pretty high to achieve a stiff behavior.
			///  - m_damping: defines how the current bodies velocity is taken into account.
			///    If you set damping to 0, you get an explicit solver, setting it to m_tau
			///    makes the solver semi-implicit. A good choice is to set it to tau.
			///
			/// This enum list allows to define some reasonable defaults: NITERS refers
			/// to the number of iterations, SOFT/MEDIUM/HARD refers to the value of tau and
			/// damp.
