	/// Virtual filesystem as a combination of sub-filesystems.
	/// The current implementation is rather simpleminded. The requested
	/// operation is tried on each mount (which has a matching prefix)
	/// in turn (most recently mounted first). An empty prefix is considered
	/// to always match so will often be used as a final fallback.
	/// 
	/// A typical setup for a mobile device might have several mounts:
	/// a readonly mount into the application bundle, then a read-write
	/// mount into an sdcard location. And finally a catch-all mount to
	/// handle absolute paths.
	/// 1. ("Resources", "/path/to/app/bundle/Resources", writable=False)
	/// 2. ("Resources", "/mnt/sdcard/Havok/Resources", writable=True)
	/// 3. ("", "", writable=False)
	/// 
	/// There is no support for whiteouts so if a file exists in more than
	/// one mount, it will still be present after removing the first one.
	/// Similarly when iterating, a file with the same name but different 
	/// contents may be returned.
