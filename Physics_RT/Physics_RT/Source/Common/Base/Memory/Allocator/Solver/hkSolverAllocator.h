	/// Allocator to handle large allocations required by the Havok Physics Solver.
	/// It manages a single input block of memory, and as required by the
	/// Havok simulation brakes this block into smaller blocks as required.
	/// Havok physics can calculate the required block size before
	/// calling hkpWorld::stepDeltaTime() by calling hkpWorld::getMemUsageForIntegration().
	/// Based on this there are two different out of memory situations:
	///     - The largest island needs a solver buffer which is bigger than the supplied one.
	///       In this case either the solver buffer has to be increased or rigid bodies
	///       removed from the simulation island. This can be done automatically by
	///       using an implementation of the hkpMemoryWatchDog.
	///     - If the largest island requires a buffer smaller than
	///       the supplied buffer, but another simulation island has already
	///       allocated away big part of the full buffer, the physics scheduler will
	///       reschedule this big island to the end of the simulation step when
	///       all the other islands have freed their solver buffer. In this case
	///       you will experience a small extra CPU hit.
	///     - If you are stepping 2 Havok world simultaneously it could happen that on world
	///       allocates a big buffer so that the other world cannot continue simulating.
	///       In this the stalled world will spin on the job queue until the big buffer becomes
	///       available. In this case you could experience a pretty decent CPU spike (several 100%)
