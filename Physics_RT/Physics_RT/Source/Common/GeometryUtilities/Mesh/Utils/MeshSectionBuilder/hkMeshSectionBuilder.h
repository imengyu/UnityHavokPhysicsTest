/// This utility is designed to help the construction of mesh sections
///
/// Specifically it hold all of the indices needed to construct a shape, as well as the hkMeshSectionCinfos
///
/// Usage is of the form of calling 'startMeshSection' at the start of a new mesh section. You can optionally pass
/// in the vertexBuffer and material associated with the section. Next multiple addTriangleIndices or addUnindexed
/// calls can be made - and these will be accumulated in internally buffers. Once all of the indices have been
/// added for the section a call to endMeshSection can be called.
///
/// Before calling endMeshSection - if the vertexBuffer or the material haven't been set - they can be set with
/// setVertexBuffer or setMaterial. It is invalid to have not set this data either in startMeshSection or with these methods
/// before the endMeshSection call.
///
/// Once all of the mesh sections have been added the hkMeshSectionCinfo array needed for construction can be retrieved
/// by calling 'getSections' and the number of sections from getNumSections
///
/// A hkMeshSectionBuilder can be emptied of its contents by calling 'clear' - allowing any internal allocation used for
/// building to be potentially reused.
