/// You can use this action to avoid constraint violation.
///
/// In some violation cases, especially in which the violations are only momentary, it may be desirable to loosen the constraint
/// limits and then restore them over time. The most common use case for this would be setting a ragdoll to a violating animation
/// pose and then switching to "full ragdoll". This operation can often cause significant popping as the ragdoll is forced into
/// a non-violating state. You can use this class to avoid that initial popping. See EaseConstraintsActionDemo.
///
/// This action wraps an array of constraints. Upon creation, it stores the limits of the constraints. When loosenConstraints
/// is called, the constrained rigid bodies are checked for violation and constraint limits are loosened if needed.
///
/// To begin restoring the original constraints, restoreConstraints must be called with a duration and the action must be added
/// to an hkpWorld. You may also simply call restoreConstraints(0) to immediately restore the constraints.
///
/// CAVEATS: This class only operates on the limits of CONSTRAINT_TYPE_RAGDOLL and CONSTRAINT_TYPE_LIMITEDHINGE constraints.
///          Other constraint types are currently not supported. Additionally, this cannot loosen constrained axes which
///          are not controlled by a limit (i.e., the non-principle axes of the limited hinge constraint, positional constraint, etc.).
///
///          This class operates on the hkpConstraintData of the hkpConstraintInstances directly. So any instances sharing that
///          data will also be affected by this action. If this is undesirable (as it will be in most cases), you'll want to make
///          a clone of the hkpConstraintInstances first.
