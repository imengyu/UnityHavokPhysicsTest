/// hkIndexedTransformSetCinfo describes transforms needed by a hkMeshBody that has multiple transforms (over and
/// above the basic position transform)
///
/// A hkMeshBody needs to have indexed transforms, if all of its shapes' mesh sections have an index. Such a mesh shape
/// is constructed when the method createCompoundShape is called on hkMeshShape. Each of the meshes is given a transform
/// index, the first shape has index 0, the next 1 and so forth.
/// When a hkMeshBody is constructed from the mesh shape, the positions of the 'child' meshes can be controlled via
/// indexed transforms. This structure holds information about the child transforms.
///
/// The other situation where indexed transforms are used is when skinning is in operation. Skinning occurs when
/// the vertex buffer for a mesh section has skinning information defined on it.
/// The actual sequence of transforms performed of a vertex will be as follows (the displayTransform
/// is the main transform, set via setTransform on the hkMeshBody):
///
/// vertex -> inverse -> matrix -> displayTransform
///
/// or as column major matrix multiplication (Havok style)
///
/// vertexOut = displayTransform * matrix * inverse * vertexIn
///
/// Only the displayMatrix and the matrices can be modified on a per body basis - the inverses are immutable throughout
/// the life of the hkMeshBody.
///
/// The inverse transforms are there for skinning and are the 'bone space' transform. Setting the value to HK_NULL
/// will indicate that inverse transforms are not needed, and may provide a significant speed improvement.
