/// This class attempts to keep the stiffness of the system constant when the time step varies from frame to frame.
///
/// This class seems to work for timesteps between 15 fps and 750 fps.
/// If you fall below the min substep count, the time per substep will change, which will
/// result in a noticeable change to the system stiffness. However, this is better than the alternative
/// where the system can totally fail if you fall bellow 2 substeps.
/// This scheme will result in noticeable jitter. A better scheme that keeps jitter down is to
/// always step at n*timePerSubstep, accumulate requestedTimeStep - n*timePerSubstep and do an
/// extra substep when that accumulated ammount > timePerSubstep. Even more solid would be if
/// you did the same, but with full timesteps rather than substeps.
