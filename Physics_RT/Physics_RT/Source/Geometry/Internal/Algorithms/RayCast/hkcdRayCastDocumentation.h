/// \page RayCastDocumentation Raycasting common documentation
/// This describes the common conventions of the hkcdRayCast* functions. Some functions have additional requirements/outputs which are detailed separately.
/// \section sec1 Return values
/// All functions return nonzero value on hit and zero on miss, and more detailed information can be extracted using hkcdRayCastResult.
/// \section sec2 Output parameters overwritten
/// Even in the case of a miss, output parameters such as hitFraction and normal may be written to with invalid values. It is the callers responsibility to save the originals, if needed.
/// \section sec3 Hit Fractions
/// Raycasts all take a hitFraction parameter. This value (between 0 and 1) defines a logical clip point along the ray. Intersections beyond this fraction are considered misses.
/// When a hit is successful, this fraction will be updated to the new intersection.
/// \section sec3 Normals
/// Upon hit, the surface normal is stored in as output.
