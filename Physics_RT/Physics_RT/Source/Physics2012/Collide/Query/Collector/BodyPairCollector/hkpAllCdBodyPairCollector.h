	/// hkpAllCdBodyPairCollector collects all body pairs from the hkpCollisionAgent::getPenetrations() call.
	/// It simply takes all hkpCdBody pairs and stores them into a list, which you can get from calling getHits().
	/// It never causes an early out.
	/// Note: As this class actually can't store the hkpCdBody, it converts each hkpCdBody into
	/// the root hkpCollidable and the (leave) hkpShapeKey. If you have only one hkpShapeCollection in your shape hierarchy,
	/// this information should be enough to identify your triangle. If you need access to all details, you have to
	/// implement your own hkpCdBodyPairCollector.
