/// The mesh body is a transformed instance of a mesh shape
///
/// This interface is implemented to allow Havok libraries such as destruction to communicate with a graphics implementation.
///
/// Generally speaking mesh bodies are constructed using the 'createBody' factory method on an hkMeshSystem instance.
/// A mesh body created on a hkMeshSystem in general can only be used on the instance it was constructed on.
///
/// The hkMeshBody is just a renderable instantiation of a hkMeshShape. The only additional data the body has over the shape
/// is where to draw the mesh shape. Each hkMeshBody has a transform which locates the body in the scene.
/// If the mesh shape associated with the mesh body has skinning information or per mesh section transform indices, additional
/// position information comes in the form of the indexed transform. Each transform is controls a bone and/or a mesh section
/// transform index.
///
/// To update the position of a hkMeshBody - the methods setTransform() and setIndexedTransforms() can be used. In and of
/// themselves they do not necessarily change the rendering position, as the application has to call 'completeUpdate' to
/// commit the updates. This allows an implementation to potentially optimize how the positional information of the moved
/// body is calculated. Thus correct usage if updating both the main transform and indexed transforms is to call both methods
/// and then finally call 'completeUpdate' so both changes can be processed in one go. If transform updates are made, and
/// 'completeUpdate' is not called behavior is undefined.
///
/// When implementing the hkMeshBody the implementation should honor how the vertex elements are shared. The most simple way to
/// do this for the hkMeshBody to clone the unique hkVertexBuffers specified in the hkMeshSections of the associated hkMeshShape.
/// If the hkVertexBuffer has been implemented correctly the clone should correctly create deep copies of the unshared members.
/// The hkMeshBody provides a way to gain access to body specific vertex buffers through the 'getVertexBuffer' method. This
/// provides per body access to per body vertex data (i.e., FLAG_NOT_SHARED elements).
///
/// If all of the elements vertex buffer are shared an implementation can return HK_NULL to the getVertexBuffer
/// method - in this situation there is no per body vertex information. Also note that an implementation is free to return a
/// vertex buffer with only the non-shared elements as necessary. Having the hkMeshBody return per instance vertex buffers
/// allows the application to modify vertex attributes on a per body level. For example if color was specified to be not
/// shared, on the vertex buffer, then each mesh body could have different colors by modifying their vertex buffers.
///
/// There are two implementations of hkMeshBody in the standard SDK distribution - firstly the hkgMeshBody, which
/// implements the interface for Havok demos \p hkgGraphics library. Secondly there is hkMemoryMeshBody - which is an implementation used by
/// the hkMemoryMeshSystem, and isn't designed for rendering but for allowing processing of hkMesh based classes in
/// memory.
