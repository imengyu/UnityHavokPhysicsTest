	/// Base class of all behavior world viewers.  
	/// 
	/// Contains the following common functionality:
	/// 
	///    (1) - Connects the viewer to the hkRemoteObjectProcess so that remote objects can
	///          be received from the server and processed.  Override receiveObjectCallback to
	///          process these objects.
	///
	///    (2) - Character visibility.  The visual debugger protocol does not support viewing a
	///          single object at a time.  It instead operates on a class of objects (e.g. all rigid 
	///          bodies or all constraints).  If a viewer wants to support per-object visibility 
	///          it must implement the functionality itself.   The hkbWorldViewerBase implements
	///          per-character visibility for behavior.
	///
	///          The implementation works with the following rules:
	///
    ///             (1) The client is responsible for telling the server which characters are 
	///                 visible.
	///             (2) Viewer instances store which characters are visible when the server
	///                 tells them.
	///             (3) If a viewer needs to show / hide information it should override the
    ///                 showCharacter and hideCharacter methods.
	///             (4) If a viewer is a local viewer (e.g. in the demo framework) all characters
	///                 are visible.
    ///
	///          Note to those implementing a client:  If implementing a client, like HAT, adhere to
	///          rule 1.  This is especially true while recording movies.  Since viewers 
	///          are created and destroyed in the process you will need to make sure that the character
    ///          visibility state is persistent across disconnect / reconnect process.
