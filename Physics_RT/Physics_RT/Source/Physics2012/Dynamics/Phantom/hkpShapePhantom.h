/// This class represents a phantom with an arbitrary shape and transform for query purposes.
///
/// Please read the hkpPhantom documentation first.
///
/// It can be used to:
///     - Get the closest points between the shape and all other nearby objects
///     - Linear cast the shape against all other objects
///     - Get the penetrations between the shape and its neighbours.
///     - For each of the three functions, all the shapes in the world whose broadphase AABBs overlap
///       with the hkpShapePhantom's broadphase AABB will be tested.
///
/// This phantom has no physical presence in the simulation.
///
/// There are two implementations of this class:
///     - the hkpSimpleShapePhantom which does not do any narrowphase caching
///     - the hkpCachingShapePhantom which caches the narrowphase by creating a
///       hkpCollisionAgent for every overlapping pair.
///
/// In order to decide which version to use, you should first read the hkpGskBaseAgent documentation.
/// Some rules when to use hkpCachingShapePhantom:
///     - Your shape is not a sphere and not a capsule (e.g., box, convexVertices...)
///     - CPU is more important than memory
///     - The position of your phantom moves with a reasonable velocity
///     - The length of the path in a linearcast is short
