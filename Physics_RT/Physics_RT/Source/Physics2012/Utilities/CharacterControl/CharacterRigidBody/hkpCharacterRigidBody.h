/// The character rigid body class is used to represent a rigid body that can move dynamically around
/// the scene. It is called character rigid body because it is usually used to represent game characters.
/// It is a rigid body analogy to hkpCharacterProxy controller. But unlike hkpCharacterProxy, which
/// is represented by virtual phantom shape, hkpCharacterRigidBody controller is physically presented in the dynamic scene.
/// Its movement is controlled by directly setting its linear and angular velocities.
///
/// If a hkpCharacterRigidBodyListener has been added, then the character rigid body issues a callback to it every
/// simulation step. The default behavior of hkpCharacterRigidBodyListener has two main purposes.
///
/// The first effectively modifies the mass of a rigid body character during collision with dynamic objects in the scene.
/// This approach allows continuous regulation of "maximal force (power)" of the character during interaction with other dynamics objects.
/// (The modification factor decreases the mass of the rigid body during response calculation.)
/// The modification factor is calculated in every step in contactProcessCallback() using the following formulas:
///
///  - Calculate angle alpha between contact normal and current acceleration.
///  - Calculate current force applied to interaction object as F = mass*acceleration*cos(alpha).
///  - If (F > Fmax) calculate mass modification factor.
///  - Apply mass modification factor to impulse calculation using hkpResponseModifier::setInvMassScalingForContact().
///
/// The acceleration is calculated as the difference between the required output velocity from state machine and the current
/// velocity of rigid body, divided by timestep.
///
/// The second purpose is the addition of extra contact points to avoid movement of character on "steep" planes. "Steep" planes are defined
/// by m_maxSlope parameter. It's the angle between the UP direction and the normal of the plane. So vertical planes have PI/2 (90 Deg) and horizontal planes 0.
/// Default value is PI/3 (60 Deg).
///
/// Implementation detail:
/// In order to issue the calls to the listener's callback, the character rigid body is a hkpWorldPostSimulationListener.
/// It is automatically added as a listener to the world when its rigid body is added as an entity. This is achieved
/// by being an hkpEntityListener to its rigid body. The user need not add or remove the character rigid body as an
/// hkpEntityListener or a hkpWorldPostSimulationListener. This is done automatically to preserve the following invariant:
/// ( object is a PostSimulationListener ) iff ( ( m_character added to world ) and ( m_listener non-null ) )
