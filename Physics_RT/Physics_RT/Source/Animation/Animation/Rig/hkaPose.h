	/// This class may be used to store and manipulate poses, representing the state of an animation sample for both the transform and float data (where present).
	/// For the transform (bone) data it uses a dual representation of the poses : LOCAL SPACE, where the transform of each bone is relative to the transform
	/// of its parent, and MODEL SPACE, where the transform of each bone is absolute (respect to a global model space).
	/// Both representations are kept in sync lazily, using the hkaSkeleton hierarchy.
	/// For the float data it simply has an array of 'float slot values' into which the float data can be sampled - the skeleton hierarchy has no effect here.
	/// hkaPose objects are associated with skeletons on construction and can therefore only hold poses based on that skeleton.
	/// N.B. There is no necessity to use a hkaPose in order to get the results of sampling (you may simply pass
	/// pointers to reserved blocks of data for the sampling to write into) but this class facilitates model/local space syncing via the hkaSkeleton
	/// associated with it.
	/// N.B. There is a requirement when using animation jobs for sampling on SPU that the float slot array
	/// be allocated to a size (number of bytes) which is a multiple of 16. The hkaPose class handles this automatically
	/// by setting the m_floatSlotValues array to have a *capacity* rounded up to a multiple of 4. If you do not use this class
	/// you may wish to use the helper method
	/// hkaMultithreadedAnimationUtils::allocateFloatSlotsArrayRoundedUpToMultipleOf16()
