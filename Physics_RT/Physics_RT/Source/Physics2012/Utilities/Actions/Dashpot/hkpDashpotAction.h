/// A dashpot is a simple version of a constraint that works like a heavily damped spring.
/// You can use a dashpot to attach two bodies together, or a body to a point in world space.
/// It is similar to a point-to-point constraint, although it is an hkpAction rather
/// an hkpConstraintInstance.
///
/// A dashpot works by applying forces to its object or objects in an attempt
/// to keep the attachment points at the same position in world space.
/// These attachment points are specified in the local space of the rigid bodies.
/// Strong forces (such as a Mouse Spring) or impulses may momentarily break this constraint, but the bodies will
/// automatically snap back to reinstate it.
/// 
/// In general, dashpots are faster than constraints, but have less stability.
/// For example, high strength values can add instability to the system, and can cause the system
/// to gain energy and even explode. It is advisable to have a strength that is equal to the heaviest
/// rigid body - for instance, if that body has a mass of 10 kg, a good value for strength
/// is 10. It is also advisable to have a damping that is 1/10 the value of the strength.
/// Values of much higher than this can make the system explode.
/// 
/// The stability of the system is also linked to
/// the size of the timesteps taken during simulation - a bigger timestep can make
/// the system more unstable. A timestep of .01666 (60 Hz) with two or three
/// substeps is generally required.
///
/// \param str The strength of the dashpot range[see notes] default==1
/// \param damp The damping coefficient of the dashpot - this determines the rate of decay of oscillations of the dashpot. A good value for damping is 1/10 the value of the strength. Range[see notes] default==0.1
