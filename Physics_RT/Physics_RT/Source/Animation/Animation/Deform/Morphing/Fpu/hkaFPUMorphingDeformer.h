/// The derived reference counted class for weighted vertex deformation.
/// Applies to both indexed and non indexed skinning.
/// By FPU it really means that it will not enforce any alignment on the input
/// or output data, but if your math configuration uses SIMD, it will use the SIMD ops
/// where it can. If you have data that has its deformable members (pos, normals, etc)
/// properly aligned, then use the SIMD version of this deformer
/// as it will be more streamlined.
/// Note this deformer only processes 3-component vectors.
/// N.B. It is important to note that these deformers are here to be used by Havok's demos but are not production quality.
/// It is assumed that deforming will be done most commonly by your graphics engine, usually in hardware on GPUs or VUs.
/// That hardware deformation is usually performed at the same time as per vertex lighting operations, so Havok cannot
/// provide optimized deformers for all such game specific usage.
