/// The second subtracts an entire animation.
/// A third less common form is also supplied which allows an animation to be subtracted from the reference
/// pose of a character.
/// NOTE: When using the results you must still set the blend hint flag in the corresponding
/// animation binding to hkaAnimationBinding::ADDITIVE.
