class hkOstream;

	/// Utility to determine if systems which are linked in, are actually used.
	/// If a system is registered but never used, it unnecessarily increases the executable code size.
	/// 
	/// By far the best approach to reduce code size is to reduce dependencies so that if it is never explicitly called,
	/// it can be stripped at link time. Sometimes this is impossible because decision to use a system depends on some runtime value.
	/// 
	/// A common pattern in these cases is to replace a hard dependency "i.e. X* x = new X()" with a soft dependency
	/// through a creation function pointer. e.g. "X* x = (*X::create)()". Since "X::create" is a function pointer, rather than a plain
	/// static method, this allows swapping implementations of X without rebuilding. Note that for a function pointer "p", C/C++ treats 
	/// "(*p)()" and "p()" identically so you will often see "X* x = X::create()" instead of the more explicit "X* x= (*X::create)()"
	///
	/// In the extreme case, you may know that in a certain configuration, X::create
	/// cannot never be called and the creation function pointer may be set to null, thus allowing the linker
	/// to strip the unused code.
	///
	/// This class allows systems to register such creation functions and report if they have been used or not.
	/// Assuming there are no hard dependencies and the only dependencies left are through function pointers,
	/// the following 2 things are needed to make a component optional:
	/// 
	/// 1) Use the macro HK_OPTIONAL_COMPONENT_DEFINE(systemName, funcPtr, implementation) to define a helper variable.
	///    Assignment of the function pointer will not happen until HK_OPTIONAL_COMPONENT_REQUEST is called (see below).
	/// 2) Whenever the component is actually used (typically in "implementation", above) indicate that system has been used
	///    by calling HK_OPTIONAL_COMPONENT_MARK_USED(systemName).
	///
	/// To use an optional component use the HK_OPTIONAL_COMPONENT_REQUEST(systemName) macro.
	/// This assigns the function pointer and marks the system as being requested.
	///
	/// Finally you can iterate through the registered systems using getFirstComponent() and getNext()
	/// to examine which systems were linked and used. Alternatively writeReport() writes a text summary.
