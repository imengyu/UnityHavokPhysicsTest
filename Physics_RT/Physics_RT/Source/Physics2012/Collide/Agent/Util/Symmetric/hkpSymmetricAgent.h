/// A symmetric agent is used to wrap a non symmetric agent with its mirrored type. The collision dispatcher
/// uses this class when creating agents that deal with two different shape types - for instance, the hkpSphereTriangleAgent.
/// Note: if you don't want to implement the linearCast in your Agent,
/// then you can subclass from hkIterativeLinearCaster,
/// however instead of using the hkpSymmetricAgent, you have to use hkpSymmetricAgentLinearCast
///
/// Reason for existence of this class:
/// hkpSymmetricAgent only adds implementation of virtual void linearCast( ..) to its base class -- hkpSymmetricAgentLinearCast.
/// Implementation of this function is missing in hkpSymmetricAgentLinearCast. The reason is for this class to be usable
/// by agent's that do not implement their own virtual void linearCast(..) method and use the implementation provided
/// by hkpIterativeLinearCastAgent. That implementation already uses the virtual getClosesPoints() function which has input hkCdBodies flipped
/// (as it is defined in the hkpSymmetricAgentLinearCast). Therefore virtual void linearCast(..) it's not overridden in hkpSymmetricAgentLinearCast
/// to avoid double-flipping of input hkCdBodies.
