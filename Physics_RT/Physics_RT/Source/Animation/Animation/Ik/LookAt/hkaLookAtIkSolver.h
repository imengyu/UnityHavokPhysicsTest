/// This IK solver operates on a single bone (specified as a transform in model space). It rotates it so the forward axis (m_fwdLS) points towards the
/// specified target (targetMS). The movement is clamped around a cone specified by m_limitAxisMS and m_limitAngle. Finally, the rotation applied by the IK
/// can be weighted by a gain value (gain), in the range [0..1]. The solver returns false if the target is over limits. Optionally, the user may specify
/// individual limits for the up, down, left, and right directions of motion
