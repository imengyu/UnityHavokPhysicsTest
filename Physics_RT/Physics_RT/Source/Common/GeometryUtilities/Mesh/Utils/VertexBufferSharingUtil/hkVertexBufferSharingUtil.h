/// Vertex buffer sharing utility
///
/// Given a array of mesh shapes, will reconstruct all of the mesh shapes, combining vertex buffers of the same format
/// into buffers of maxVertices or less. If a mesh section indexes more than maxVertices vertices, a vertex buffer will
/// be constructed of that size.
///
/// Note that the algorithm reconstructs all hkMeshShapes using the system, even if its possible it doesn't need to
///     - for example if the a section indexes all of the vertices in a vertex buffer which has more than maxVertices.
///
/// Also note that all mesh sections get translated into triangle lists - this is generally necessary as the sharing means
/// reindexing of the primitives.
///
/// The algorithm uses the actually contained vertex data as indexed by mesh sections. Vertex data doesn't have to be exactly the same, and there
/// is a threshold for what makes vertices equal. This means
///     -# If the input are already using shared vertex buffers, the output will throw out un indexed vertex indices
///     -# If there are more than one vertex buffer that contains a vertex which is 'approximately equal', they will all be potentially shared
///     -# Since there is a limit on the vertices in combined vertex buffer - a vertex which is 'approximately equal' may appear multiple times
///
/// Future updates could take into account how many vertices are shared when recombining - at the moment, the smallest are
/// recombined together, the thinking is that the small pieces are likely to be used together.
