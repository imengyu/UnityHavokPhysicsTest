/// A phantom is simply an AABB entry in the world's broadphase. It can be moved around,
/// and receives events when a new AABB overlap occurs with another phantom or entity,
/// or an existing overlap ends. These events can occur either when you move the phantom around, or another
/// object moves into or out of the phantom's AABB.
///
/// One major reason for using phantoms is to exploit frame coherency the broadphase. Moving objects
/// around within the broadphase can be 5-100 times faster than querying the broadphase from scratch.
/// Therefore phantoms should be is used for collision queries where you wish to make several queries for
/// an object that is relatively persistent in location:
///     - Use hkpShapePhantom if your query involves a shape (e.g find all objects penetrating a sphere).
///     - Use hkpAabbPhantom if your query does not use a shape (e.g., ray casts or simple AABB checks).
///     - You can also an hkpAabbPhantom to create areas where events occur if the area is entered.
/// 
/// Phantoms can raise a number of events:
///     - phantom added/removed from the world ( received by hkpPhantomListener),
///     - broadphase overlaps created/destroyed (received by hkpPhantomOverlapListener).
///       Note: the hkpPhantomOverlapListener can actually reject a new overlap, thereby acting as
///       a user collision filter.
///
/// Notes:
///     - All broadphase objects in the Havok world are actually members of hkpCollidable objects.
///     - The addition and removal callback functions are addOverlappingCollidable and removeOverlappingCollidable (with the cast done for you).
///     - All hkpPhantom objects use the hkpWorld::getCollisionFilter as the filter for broadphase updates, and shape queries. The one notable
///       exception is that removeOverlappingCollidable() callbacks are fired independent of the current filter. See the UserGuide for more details.
///
/// Attention: You only get good broadphase CPU, if the AABB is not jumping randomly around in your world. If it is,
/// the hkpPhantom can only do a poor job of caching the broadphase and can result in a slower performance than calling the
/// same functions in hkpWorld.
