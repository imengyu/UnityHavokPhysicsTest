	/// The hkStackTraceReportUtil is a utility class used to produce reports that use call stack information.
	/// 
	/// For the utility to operate correctly it requires that the hkTrackerScanSnapshot has stack track information.
	/// This is most easy achieved by having a memory system that can produce stack trace information (such
	/// as the hkCheckingMemorySystem) that implements methods to find out for each allocation what the stack trace
	/// was. For the Havok demos - the hkCheckingMemorySystem can be used just by passing -c on the command line
	/// to the demo.
	///
	/// Generally the reports work by associating all allocations taking place from a function address. Thus you
	/// should consider the memory reported as the cumulative amount of memory from all code executed from the specified
	/// function address. Thus for a single threaded application 'main' will include all of the allocated memory of the system -
	/// as all memory must have been allocated underneath main.
