/// Holds a unique set of int indices.
///
/// This implements a 'mathematical' style set of int values or 'indices'.
///
/// A set either contains or does not contain an index. Sets can be combined via the standard set
/// operations of setIntersection, setUnion and setDifference. This operations are designed to be relatively
/// fast. Note that the sets passed in cannot be the same as the set that is being modified.
///
/// Its possible to modify the contents using startUpdate/endUpdate. Members can be added/removed from the
/// set by manipulating the array. Doing endUpdate will sort the members, and remove any duplicates.
///
/// The implementation holds the indices held in the set in a sorted array. Having a sorted list, allows for fast
/// comparison, and the boolean operations. It also allows relatively fast containment testing - using a binary chop
/// giving O(log2(n)) performance.
