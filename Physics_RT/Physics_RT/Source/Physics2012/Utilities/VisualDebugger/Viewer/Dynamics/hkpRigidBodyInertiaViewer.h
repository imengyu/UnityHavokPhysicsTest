	/// Shows the inertia tensor of all rigid bodies added to the world.
	/// The Inertia Tensor is displayed as a box whose dimensions are such that it would have the same inertia
	/// tensor as the body in question, if it was also of equal mass. In other words, it shows an object which
	/// would behave identically from a dynamic point of view (though obviously, not from a collision detection
	/// point of view).
	/// In the case of a rigid body being simulated as an Oriented Particle this box will always be a cube aligned in local space.
	/// In the case of a rigid body being simulated with a DIAGONAL inertia tensor this box may have different edge
	/// lengths, but will still be aligned in local space.
	/// Currently, a FULL inertia tensor is not supported.
	/// N.B. Actually, we display a box which is *slightly bigger* than the one defined above by a factor of 1.01, just for
	/// ease of display.
