class hkTrackerTypeTreeCache;

	/// The hkScanReportUtil class provides a set of functionality useful to producing
	/// reports from hkTrackerScanSnapshot objects.
	/// 
	/// One of the overriding issues to do with memory reporting has to do with ownership.
	/// The hkTrackerScanSnapshot contains 'Blocks' of memory - and the snapshot also contains
	/// information about the connection of one block to another through 'references'. These
	/// references are determined by the hkTrackerScanCalculator - and a Block will have a connection
	/// to another block if it contains a pointer to it for example.
	/// What this means is that the hkTrackerScanSnapshot is made up of Blocks and these are connected
	/// together in a graph. How the graph is connected is basically arbitrary - other than a
	/// pointer from one block from the other is found.
	///
	/// Generally though we think of one object 'owning' another object. It may be that an object
	/// is shared - meaning one object is owned by more than one other object.
	/// In order to simplify reporting its often useful to deal with Blocks as if they can only
	/// be owned by another Block.
	///
	/// In order to determine ownership many of the functions of hkScanReportUtil do breadth first
	/// traversal from roots. If a block is reached by a traversal, and does not belong to another
	/// Block, it is owned by the Block it was reached from.
	/// When doing the traversal its necessary to have blocks to start the traversal from - described
	/// in this functionality as root blocks. In some methods you can directly specify a root block/s
	/// to perform traversal from.
	/// 
	/// It's often useful to use type allocations as the root blocks for traversal. This makes ownership
	/// fairly fine grained, but the fine granularity generally avoids problems with sharing, as sharing
	/// often takes place at the level of objects.
