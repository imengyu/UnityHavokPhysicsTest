/// This class implements a very basic streaming of a hkpMoppCode object to and from an
/// Archive (platform independent stream). It may be useful to use these methods as a guideline
/// for implementing your own file format, as the implementations used here read/write only the
/// minimum data required.
/// In particular, only basic corruption "safety" checks are included. It is up to the user to ensure
/// any "streamed" MOPP data files are in sync with the hkpMoppBvTreeShape you assign them to, otherwise
/// collision detection will fail. It may be advisable to "hash" the shape into a checksum, and
/// write this as additional data into the file, to avoid any such conflicts.
/// This code reads/writes only one hkMoppCodes per Archive, but you may wish to concatenate several
/// hkMoppCodes into a single Archive using the methods below as a guideline.
///
/// NOTICE : The serialization framework (hkSerialize library) available in Havok 2.2 and late versions offers a much more
/// integrated way to serialize MOPP code and other data.
