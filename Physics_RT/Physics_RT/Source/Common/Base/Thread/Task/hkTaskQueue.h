/// Task queue used to process task graphs (hkDefaultTaskGraph) from multiple threads. The normal work flow is as follows:
/// 1. A thread adds a graph to the queue via addGraph(), becoming the owner of the graph. Tasks without unfulfilled
///    dependencies in the graph become immediately available.
/// 2. Threads obtain tasks from the queue via finishTaskAndGetNext(), process them calling hkTask::process() and
///    report them as finished in the queue using finishTask() or finishTaskAndGetNext(). When a task is finished
///    dependencies of other tasks on it are marked as fulfilled potentially making them available for processing.
/// 3. The owner thread either polls the queue to see if its graph has been finished with isGraphFinished() or joins
///	   processing the tasks in the graph with finishTaskAndGetNextInGraph().
/// 4. Once the graph is finihsed the owner thread calls removeGraph().
