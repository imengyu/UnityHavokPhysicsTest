	/// The hkTrackerScanSnapshot is a structure representing the usage of memory at a particular instance.
	///
	/// A hkTrackerScanSnapshot can be produced by providing a hkTrackerSnapshot to the hkTrackerScanCalculator. Once the hkTrackerScanSnapshot
	/// has been produced, the actual underlying objects that the representation has been created from can change, and be destroyed
	/// without affecting the hkTrackerScanSnapshot.
	///
	/// The hkTrackerScanSnapshot can be thought of as a 'database' describing the inter-relationships and types of all the allocations at the
	/// time the hkTrackerSnapshot was taken - and the database is independent of the existence of the objects.
	/// 
	/// The snapshot consists of two basic types 'Allocation's and 'Block's. An Allocation is
	/// an allocation that has been made - usually these are determined via performing a memory
	/// walk on the hkMemorySystem. Allocations can be thought of the low level description of underlying
	/// memory allocations. Memory allocations cannot overlap, and must be unique.
	///
	/// A 'Block' is a more high level concept. It describes how a particular piece of memory is being used in the form
	/// of its type. Additionally a Block also stores how it 'references' other Blocks.
	/// A reference in this context generally means that it contains a pointer to another Block. A block also stores
	/// the Allocation it belongs to. A Block must in its entirety fit into a single Allocation.
	/// 
	/// For example if an object is 'new'd there will be an Allocation describing the underlying memory
	/// that is holding the object, and there will be Block which will describe that a piece of the Allocation (typically all of it) that
	/// holds an object of the type.
	/// An Allocation that holds an object may not be the same size as the Block - because the allocator may assign more space than the object needs
	/// for example.
	/// 
	/// Extending the idea - take an hkArray<int> of capacity 16, and holding 2 elements. The allocation for the storage for the array
	/// will be at least 16 * sizeof(int) bytes. The block will start at the start of the allocation and be 2 * sizeof(int) bytes in size. It will
	/// also have the type 'int[2]' associated with it.
	///
	/// The data held inside of hkScanSnaphsot is arranged so that finding out information about blocks and allocations is reasonably fast.
	/// For example all Allocations are held in address order, so finding if an address belongs to a particular allocation can
	/// be found fairly quickly with a binary chop.
	///
	/// Sometimes its useful to know where an Allocation originated from. This can be determined from an Allocation from the m_traceId.
	/// The traceId can be applied to the callTree to determine the call stack that produced the Allocation. This can often be
	/// used to determine when a Block was created - by finding the associated Allocation. If the hkCheckingMemorySystem is used
	/// (this can be switched on in the Havok demos with the -c option) allocations will have stack trace ids associated with them. The
	/// hkTrackerScanCalculator requires a hkMemorySystem which implements the stack tracing functions for the hkTrackerScanCalculator to store the
	/// trace in the hkTrackerScanCalculator.
	/// 
	/// The stack trace can be turned back into readable text using the hkStackTracer.
