	/// This event is fired in a ContactUpdateCallback for each collision pair when you call hkpContactUpdater::updateContacts().
	/// It is equivalent to the hkpContactProcessEvent, except that instead of a list of collision points (the hkpProcessCollisionOutput field
	/// in the hkpContactProcessEvent, this event returns an array of contact point ids. From these ids you can get all the
	/// contact points and their associated contact point properties by calling hkpDynamicsContactMgr::getContactPoint() and
	/// hkpDynamicsContactMgr::getContactPointProperties() on the m_contactMgr.
	/// This event allows you to change the friction, and restitution for the collision points (which are not recalculated by the
	/// system otherwise).

	/// contacts to be updated immediately. This is in fact the default behavior of hkpContactUpdater::updateContacts().
	/// You can override this behavior, (which you may need to do if you are using a friction map etc) by passing in your own
	/// callback function to handle the hkpContactUpdateEvent. The source code for the default callback -
	/// hkpContactUpdater::defaultFrictionUpdateCallback() is public, as an example

			/// stored in the material of the two rigid bodies in collision. This is the same as the default behaviour
			/// of the system when new contact points are created.
		static void HK_CALL defaultFrictionUpdateCallback( hkpContactUpdateEvent& event );

			/// Call this function to update all the friction on all contact points for a rigid body.
			/// NOTE: if the rigid body is fixed, this function is quite slow, as it has to analyse the entire world
			/// to search for all the dynamic bodies in contact.
