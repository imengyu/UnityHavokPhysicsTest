/// constraints, and is the rotational equivalent of an hkpDashpotAction.
/// When one of the dashpot's bodies is oriented away from the specified rotation, the dashpot works so that it
/// will tend to return to that rotation. You construct the dashpot by specifying the rigid
/// body or bodies, and the desired orientation (rot). You can also specify stiffness
/// and damping parameters.

/// The default strength and damping parameters are suitable for dashpots connected
/// to rigid bodies of mass 1kg. For rigid bodies with larger masses, higher
/// strengths may be needed.
