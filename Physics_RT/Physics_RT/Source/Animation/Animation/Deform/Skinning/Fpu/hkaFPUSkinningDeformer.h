#ifndef HK_FPU_SKINNING_DEFORMER_H
#define HK_FPU_SKINNING_DEFORMER_H

/// The class for weighted vertex deformation.
/// Applies to both indexed and non indexed skinning.
/// This is a pure, normal hkFloat32ing point only deformer. Neither your input
/// or your output needs to be aligned for SIMD.
/// With a SIMD-enabled hkMath library, it will use unaligned SIMD ops to speed things up.
/// Note this deformer only processes 3-component vectors.
/// N.B. It is important to note that these deformers are here to be used by Havok's demos but are not production quality.
/// It is assumed that deforming will be done most commonly by your graphics engine, usually in hardware on GPUs or VUs.
/// That hardware deformation is usually performed at the same time as per vertex lighting operations, so Havok cannot
/// provide optimized deformers for all such game specific usage.
