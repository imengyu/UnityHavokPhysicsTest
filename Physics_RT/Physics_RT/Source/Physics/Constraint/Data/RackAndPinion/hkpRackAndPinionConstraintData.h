/// This constraint represents interaction between a pinion and a rack elements; or between a screw and its nut.
///
/// This is a simple one-dimensional constraint only. In order to create a meaningful mechanism, the elements linked
/// must be connected to other external constraints -- most probably a prismatic constraint for the rack, and a hinge,
/// or limited-hinge for the pinion. This constraintData has helper functions that will allow you to easily create
/// those.
///
/// Note that the axes of the rack and pinion don't have to be fixed at one relative position. The axes are free
/// to move in a (physically sensible) range. And the constraints should properly track the contact point of the parts.
/// It will also work, when the parts are physically disjoint at times. Note that the interaction force is always
/// determined by the direction of the bodyB (and it's shiftAxis, which is stored in bodyB's local space).
///
/// If you experience stability problems in bigger setups, the external prismatic and hinge constraints should
/// have higher priority or the rack-and-pinion constraint should be added first.
