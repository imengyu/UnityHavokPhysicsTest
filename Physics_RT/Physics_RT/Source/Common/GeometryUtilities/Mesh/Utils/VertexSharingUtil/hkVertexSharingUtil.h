/// Small utility which helps to share vertices which have the same attributes (like uv/normals/tangents ...).
///
/// The utility is designed to be able to share vertices of any format. It works out if a vertex is that same
/// by comparing the elements. It does not use a memory compare - but goes though each element type using a
/// suitable comparison for the type and taking into account a threshold for equality. The threshold value
/// is a public member that can be altered.
///
/// Not using a memory comparison allows the sharing to compare vertices that are very similar in value and equate them
/// to being the same value. The work required to the comparison this way is greater - but gives more flexibility. In particular
/// when converting vertices from hkdGeometry - using barycentric coordinates, vertices can be produced with slightly different
/// values. This utility is used to share the vertices in this situation.
///
/// Internally the vertices are held in a contiguous chunk of memory - in the same layout as vertices held in the
/// hkMemoryVertexBuffer.
///
/// To use the tool, a hkVertexSharing object should be instantiated. 'Begin' should be called to start sharing
/// vertices - the parameter determines the format of the vertices to be added.
///
/// The data for the vertex you want to add should be stored in the 'work vertex' which is a chunk of memory large enough
/// to hold a complete vertex. The size of a vertex in bytes - can always be determined by the getVertexStride method.
/// To actually add the vertex held in the 'work vertex' the addVertex method is used. It takes as a parameter a
/// hash that can be rapidly be used to determine vertices which could be shared. For example - there could be multiple
/// vertices produced for a single vertex index (say with different normals) - the index could be used as hash in this
/// case. Or if the position can uniquely be used to identify a vertex position to share - a hash of the position could be used.
///
/// Once all of the vertices have been added calling the 'end' method will produce a LockedVertices structure holding
/// all of the unique vertices.
