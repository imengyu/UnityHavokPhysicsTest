	/// The hierarchical summary report is designed around a hierarchy of ownership of blocks.
	/// This hierarchy is stored in a parentMap (and associated childMultiMap).
	/// The relationship is basically a tree - unfortunately the trees of ownership can be very deep (for example
	/// a linked list can be seen as a type of 'tree' with an arbitrary depth).
	/// To get around the depth problem the report is provided with a maximum depth - any blocks beneath
	/// this depth will be reported in summary.
	///
	/// The hierarchy/ownership relationship is displayed in the report as an indentation.
