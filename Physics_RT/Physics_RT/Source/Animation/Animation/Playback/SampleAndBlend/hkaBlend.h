namespace hkaBlend
{
// Used for constructing something analogous to a linear combination of poses
// This can be thought of as base := base + sample * sampleW * sampleAlpha
// and for float data, it is. For general poses, the calculations are a little
// more complex, but it can still be used to take a weighted average of poses
// in a way analogous to the operations on vectors.
// sampleW is a per-track weight, and sampleAlpha is a single global alpha
// The template parameter indicates which operations are performed:
//  If BLEND_USE_BASE is not specified, base is assumed to be zero and not blended
//         (useful for initialization, etc.)
//  If BLEND_USE_SAMPLE_WEIGHT is not specified, sampleW is assumed to be 1 everywhere
//  If BLEND_USE_SAMPLE_ALPHA is not specified, sampleAlpha is assumed to be 1.
// At least one of BLEND_USE_SAMPLE_ALPHA and BLEND_USE_SAMPLE_WEIGHT must be specified.
// Specifying all options is the most general function, but using only the necessary
// ones will be faster. Type must be hkReal or hkQsTransform.
// This function is alias-safe (base == sample is OK), but not overlap-safe.
enum {BLEND_USE_BASE=1, BLEND_USE_SAMPLE_WEIGHT=2, BLEND_USE_SAMPLE_ALPHA=4};
template <class Type, int flags>
void HK_CALL blendAddMul(
	Type* base, hkReal* baseW, // accumulator
	const Type* sample, const hkReal* sampleW, hkSimdRealParameter sampleAlpha, // new pose
	int n); // length

// Similar to the above but for additive animations.  Unlike the above, this one does not need to accumulate the weights because they are not needed.
template <class Type, int flags>
void HK_CALL blendAdditive(
	Type* base,
	const Type* sample, const hkReal* sampleW, hkSimdRealParameter sampleAlpha, // new pose
	int n); // length

// After using blendAddMul to combine animations, the resulting pose must be
// normalized before it can be drawn. This is analogous to the division step
// after taking a weighted average. Type must be hkReal or hkQsTransform.
