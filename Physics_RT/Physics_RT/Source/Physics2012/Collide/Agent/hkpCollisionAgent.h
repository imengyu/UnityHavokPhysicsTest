/// The base class for all collision agents, which are used for pair-wise narrowphase collision detection between shapes.
/// To create and query a collision agent you need to have two hkpCollidable objects
/// (which wrap the hkpShape objects together with associated transforms),
/// and you need to create the agent via the hkpCollisionDispatcher.
/// The collision agent provides 3 queries:
/// - getPenetations (for simply determining whether two hkpCollidable objects are overlapping).
/// - getClosestPoints (to determine the closest point(s) between two hkpCollidable object).
/// - linearCast (to determine the contact point when casting one hkpCollidable against the other).
/// Most implementations of this hkpCollisionAgent also provide static versions of these three functions.
/// This allows for querying objects without an agent, however you have to use the hkpCollisionDispatcher
/// to lookup the right static function.
/// Note that the interface takes hkpCdBody objects. However, if you are calling the hkpCollisionAgent at the user level, you must use hkpCollidable objects
/// as input (which inherit from hkpCdBody).
