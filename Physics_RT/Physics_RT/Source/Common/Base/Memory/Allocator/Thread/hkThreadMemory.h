#ifndef HKBASE_hkThreadMemory_H
#define HKBASE_hkThreadMemory_H

	/// This class is a block cache used in conjunction with another allocator.
	///
	/// Notes:
	///    - It is highly optimized for handling memory for a single thread. It
	///      is doing so by caching a limited number of blocks in a thread local
	///      free list. There is a several free lists for different sizes of blocks.
	///    - Each free list (for each size) can hold only a maximum number of items (m_maxNumElemsOnFreeList)
	///    - If maxNumElemsOnFreeList==0 than the free list is not checked at all and the hkThreadMemory
	///      calls the appropriate parent allocator functions
	///    - If for a given size, there is no free block on the free list, some blocks are fetched by calling
	///      parents blockAllocBatch() method
	///    - If a block is freed, it is assumed that this block was allocated by this memory manager, its
	///      corresponding free list is found (by rounding up the size of the block to the next suitable
	///      block size) and the block added to the free list.
	///      If the number of elements on this particular free list is exceeding m_maxNumElemsOnFreeList, some
	///      blocks are forwarded to the parents blockFreeBatch() method.
	///
	/// Notes:
	///     - all allocations should be 16 byte aligned.
	///     - Only if you use this class with the pool memory, you are allowed to set maxNumElemsOnFreeList != 0
