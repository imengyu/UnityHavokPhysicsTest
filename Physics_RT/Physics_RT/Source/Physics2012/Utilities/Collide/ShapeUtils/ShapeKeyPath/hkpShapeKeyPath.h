/// list of shape key array, from the root shape to a leaf shape.

/// The hkpShapeKeyPath constructors allows to create it from different situations where a shape hierarchy has to be
/// traversed (ray casting, contact point callbacks), allowing to use a common interface for these various cases.
/// The getIterator() function generates an iterator which will provide access to the shapes along the path.
/// 
/// Every iteration goes one level down in the hierarchy until the leaf shape is reached.
/// However, keep in mind that :
///  - The hkpShape* returned by getShape() is only guaranteed to be valid until the subsequent call to next() or
///    the destruction of the iterator. To get the shapes in a more permanent storage, use the getShapes() function
///    which take user-supplied buffers as arguments.
///  - When the leaf shape is reached, the subsequent call to next() will invalidate the iterator.
///    The getShape() function will then return HK_NULL.
