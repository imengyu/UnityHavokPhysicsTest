	/// You can use this action to reduce CPU hits that occur when a new body is added to a hkpWorld in a penetrating state.
	///
	/// When you add a simple shape, like a box, and place it in a way that it deeply intersects with around 8 triangles of a landscape
	/// mesh -- then you can expect high numbers of unjustified TOI events being handled. In a simple test case we performed, there were
	/// around 10 TOIs for a moving-quality body, and around 80 for a critical-quality body.
	///
	/// This utility controls the m_allowedPenetrationDepth property of a rigid body over a short time of, e.g., a few seconds, to
	/// avoid those unneeded TOIs and to allow the bodies to recover from penetration with normal collision response.
	/// After m_timePassed reaches m_duration, the m_alloedPenetrationDepth of the hkpRigidBody is set back to its original value.
	///
	/// Additionally this utility can also reduce the strength at which the solver corrects inter-body penetrations. This is done by
	/// iterating over all contact points, and reducing the penetration distance, that is later fed into the constraint solver.
	/// As the result, less jitter may occur when bodies recover from penetration.
