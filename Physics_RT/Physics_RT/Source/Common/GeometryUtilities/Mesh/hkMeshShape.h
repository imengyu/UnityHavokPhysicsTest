/// A material used with a mesh
///
/// This interface is used to represent a graphics engines specific implementation of a material. In this context a
/// 'material' means how a geometric primitive is rasterized in terms of lighting, texture mapping and so forth.
/// The mesh system doesn't need any direct details on how an engines material works, just a handle to tell an implementation
/// which internal material to use.
///
/// The interface has methods which allow determination of if vertex buffers/formats are suitable for a material. For example
/// a material may require vertex normals to render correctly - these methods provide a way for the material to communicate
/// with utilities about such requirements, in doing so allow such elements to be created as needed.
///
/// The createCompatibleVertexBuffer() is part of the interface as well as createCompatibleVertexFormat(), because an implementation
/// may have a method of rapidly converting a vertex buffer into an appropriate format for the material, or perhaps the vertex
/// buffer needs to have vertex elements generated which the standard tools do not know about. For example a material may require
/// a channel to hold a certain type of noise - the tools could not generate this but the material may be able to.
