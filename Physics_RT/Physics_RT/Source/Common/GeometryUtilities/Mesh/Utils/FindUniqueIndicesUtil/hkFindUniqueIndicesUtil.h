/// A simple utility to determine the unique set of used indices
///
/// The utility needs to know the index of the maximum vertex index that is going to be processed
/// doing so allows it to use very fast array lookups to determine if an index has already been added.
///
/// Before any indices can be added the 'initialize' method must be called with the number of vertex indices
/// (i.e., 1 more than the maximum index value). Now indices can be added by calling 'addIndex' - it will return
/// the index given to that index.
///
/// The m_uniqueIndices member will hold the original indices of the indices added. The position in uniqueIndices
/// determines what value was assigned to that index.
///
/// The member m_indexMap - holds -1 for any source index which wasn't added, or the index of the output index for the
/// the source index otherwise.
