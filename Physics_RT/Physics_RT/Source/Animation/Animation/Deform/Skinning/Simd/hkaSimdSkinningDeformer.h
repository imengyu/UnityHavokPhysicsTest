#define HKA_SIMD_SKINNING_DEFORMER_H

/// The class for a SIMD based implementation of weighted vertex deformation.
/// Applies to both indexed and non indexed skinning.
/// This deformer requires that the input buffers' deformable
/// members (pos, normals) be aligned for SIMD processing
/// and for faster operation make sure that the outputs are aligned as well.
/// Note this deformer only processes 3-component vectors.
/// N.B. It is important to note that these deformers are here to be used by Havok's demos but are not production quality.
/// It is assumed that deforming will be done most commonly by your graphics engine, usually in hardware on GPUs or VUs.
/// That hardware deformation is usually performed at the same time as per vertex lighting operations, so Havok cannot
/// provide optimized deformers for all such game specific usage.
