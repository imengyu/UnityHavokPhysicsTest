	/// Tulip is an open source graph data visualization tool.
	/// This utility's purpose is to take memory scan snapshots and put them in
	/// a form where they can be visualized inside of the tulip application.
	///
	/// Tulip is available for download here:
	/// http://sourceforge.net/projects/auber/
	///
	/// The output of the reports should be sent to '.tlp' files, for loading into tulip.
	/// Note that when initially loading a file none of the blocks are positioned, so you will generally get a
	/// single block in the middle of the screen. To position the blocks you can use 'Algorithm>Layout' menu
	/// option from within tulip and then set a suitable algorithm for the kind of graph the report is using.
	/// For example 'Algorithm/Tree/Bubble Tree' is suitable for tree like graphs - as produced by reportCategorySummary.
	/// You'll be more restricted in the type of layouts form 'report' as they are generally not trees.
	///
	/// In the report the size of the allocation is shown by the size of the block or more specifically the volume of the block.
	/// I.e., an allocation of 64 bytes will be shown by a cube 4 by 4 by 4.
